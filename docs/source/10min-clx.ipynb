    "## What are these libraries?\n",
    "\n",
    "CLX provides a simple API for analysts, data scientists and engineers to quickly get started with applying RAPIDS to real-world cyber use cases. CLX uses the cuDF GPU-DataFrame to execute cyber analytics functionality at fast speeds. The following packages are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>ml - Machine learning functionality</li>\n",
    "<li>ip - IPv4 data translation and parsing</li>\n",
    "<li>parsers - Log Event parsing</li>\n",
    "<li>io - Input and output features for a workflow</li>\n",
    "<li>workflow - Workflow which receives input data and produces analytical output data</li>\n",
    "<li>osi - Open source integration (VirusTotal, Farsight)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use CLX\n",
    "\n",
    "Use CLX to build your cyber data analytics workflows in a gpu-accelerated environment. CLX contains common cyber and cyber-ML functionality such as log parsing for specific data sources, cyber data type parsing (such as for IPv4) and dga detection. CLX also provides the ability to integrate this functionality into a CLX workflow which simply executes the series of parsing and ML functions needed to produce cyber analytic output.\n"
