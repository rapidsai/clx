    "## Anomaly detection using Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies (LODA) with CuPy and RAPIDS. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Authors:\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been studied within wide areas and application domains. Several anomaly detection algorithms are generic, while many are developed specifically to the domain of interest. In practice, several ensemble-based anomaly detection algorithms have been shown to have superior performance on many benchmark datasets, namely Isolation Forest, Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies (LODA), and an ensemble of Gaussian mixture models ...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loda algorithm is one of the high performing generic anomaly detection algorithms. Loda detects anomalies in a dataset by computing the likelihood of each point using an ensemble of one-dimensional histograms. These histograms approximate the joint probability of the data using sparse random projections. For convenience, negative log-likelihood (NLL) is used as scoring criteria, where large NLL value indicates an instance as anomalous. Since anomalies are expected to be points with smaller likelihood under the fitted probability model (the histograms in this case). \n",
    "\n",
    "Loda is a good candidate to use for many cybersecurity use case because of being computationally fast. It is linear with respect to training sample $n$ and dimension $d$. Additionally, Loda is easy to update in real-time from a stream of data by implementating the histogram as an [online-histograms](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/ben-haim10a/ben-haim10a.pdf). This makes it an attractive choice to use in the domain of concept drifts, such as intrusion detection, behavioral analytics, sensor outages ...etc, where a large stream of data is expected in online streams. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple term Loda is constructed as $k$ one-dimensional histograms ${h}^k_{i=1}$, where each histogram approximate probability density $p$ of input data projected into one-dimensional sparse projection vector $\\{w_i \\in R^d\\}^k_{i=1}$. The histogram are set as fixed-width and the number of bins are set as hyperparameter or computed heuristically. The algorithm works as follows, first it constructs projection vector $w_i$ by starting all-zero vector, selecting $k=\\sqrt{d}$ features at random, and replacing this with random number generated from standard normal distribution. Then a training example $X$ is projected to the real lines as $w^T_iX$, and a fixed-width histogram density estimator $p_i$ is estimated from the projected data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute anomaly score of a query point $X_q$, Loda computes the average negative log likelihood (NLL) as follows: $$f(X_q) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_i^k -\\log p_i(w_i^TX_q)$$"

    "### Implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "Loda being a projection based algorithm makes it a good choice to use GPUs for the matrix operations. For both training and inference, the ensemble of random projection vectors $w^T_iX$ can be implemented efficiently using cupy and parallelize across GPUs for further acceleration."

    "\n",
    "To explain the cause of anomalies Loda utilize contributions of each feature across the histograms. Recognize that each histogram $H$ are made with sparse projections $w$, this method can be used to rank each features according to their contributions to the instance anomalousness. To measure the importance of a particular feature, the anomaly score difference is computed from all histograms when the feature is selected in the projection from all the histograms when the feature is not selected. This allows to measure how influential the feature is in isolating an instance as anomaly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $I_j$ denotes a vector score of histograms that use feature $j$, and let $\\bar{I}_j$ be the vector score of histograms that don't use feature $j$ and suppose the corresponding mean and variance of the scores are denoted as ($\\mu_j, s^2_j$)and $(\\bar{\\mu_j},\\bar{s^2_j})$ respectively.  Then anomaly explanation of a feature is given by one-tailed two-sample $t$ test with a test statistics given as follows. \n",

Larger t-score indicates the more influence the feature has on identifying the instance as anomaly. We rank each feature based on their $t_{score}$ to output the most influential features for the anomalousness of the instance.  \n"
