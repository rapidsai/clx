    "## Anomaly detection using Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies (LODA) with CuPy and RAPIDS. \n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been studied within wide areas and application domains. Several anomaly detection algorithms are generic while many are developed specifically to the domain of interest. In practice, several ensemble-based anomaly detection algorithms have been shown to have superior performance on many benchmark datasets, namely Isolation Forest, Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies (LODA), and an ensemble of Gaussian mixture models ...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loda algorithm is one of the good performing generic anomaly detection algorithms. Loda detects anomalies in a dataset by computing the likelihood of data points using an ensemble of one-dimensional histograms. These histograms serve as density estimators by approximating the joint probability of the data using sparse random projections. For convenience, a negative log-likelihood (NLL) is used as scoring criteria, where a large NLL value indicates an instance to be anomalous. This is because anomalies are expected to be points with smaller likelihood under the fitted probability model (the histograms in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Loda is computationally fast and easily adopted for data streams. It is linear with respect to training sample $n$ and data dimension $d$. This makes it a good candidate to use as an anomaly detector model for many cybersecurity use cases, such as intrusion detection, behavioral analytics, sensor outages ...etc. Additionally, Loda can be easily adopted to an online-learning algorithm by implementing the histogram as an [online-histograms](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/ben-haim10a/ben-haim10a.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple term Loda is constructed as a $k$ one-dimensional histograms ${h}^k_{i=1}$, where each histogram approximate probability density $p$ of input data projected into one-dimensional sparse projection vector $\\{w_i \\in R^d\\}^k_{i=1}$. The histogram is set as fixed-width and the number of bins is set as hyperparameter or computed heuristically. During training, the algorithm first constructs projection vectors $w_i$ by starting all-zero vector, selecting $k=\\sqrt{d}$ features at random, and replacing this with a random number generated from a standard normal distribution. Then a training example $X$ is projected to the real lines as $w^T_iX$, and a fixed-width histogram density estimator $p_i$ is estimated from the projected data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the anomaly score of a query point $X_q$, Loda computes the average negative log likelihood (NLL) as follows: $$f(X_q) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_i^k -\\log p_i(w_i^TX_q)$$"

Recognize that each histogram $H$ are made with sparse projections $w$, this method can be used to rank each features according to their contributions to the instance anomalousness. To measure the importance of a particular feature, the anomaly score difference is computed from all histograms when the feature is selected in the projection from all the histograms when the feature is not selected. This allows to measure how influential the feature is in isolating an instance as anomaly. \n",

Then anomaly explanation of a feature is given by one-tailed two-sample $t$ test with a test statistics given as follows. \n",

    "In this notebook we show a GPU implementation of Loda algorithm for anomaly detection and explanation. We evaluate the implementation on anomaly benchmark dataset to identify anomalies and explain the features that cause for its identification using RAPDIS. In the future work we will show use of Loda for different cybersecurity usecases. "
